# ESHAPE: Morphology Analysis tools

      The elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) can extract arbitrary two-dimensional curves to a series of elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs), which was originally proposed by Kuhl and Giardina in 1982 for object recognition of a segment in an image. As a powerful mathematical tool, EFA can provide quantitative criteria for shape analysis, classification, reconstruction, and modeling, which has been widely used in plant science, marine biology, evolutionary biology and anthropology. The procedure of GM using EFA includes contour extraction, EFDs calculation and EFD normalization. Aside from the low efficiency in outline extraction and low quantity in datasets, EFD normalization has long been a matter of trouble (Haines and Crampton 2000, Bonhomme et al., 2014, Wishkerman et al., 2018). None of existing normalization method can give homologous results when dealing with planar translation, scaling, rotation, symmetry, reverse, and analogous basic transformations simultaneously. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the computational efficiency of EFA for true EFD normalization and develop a user-friendly software for organ annotation and geometric feature extraction using digital specimens.
      We develop a user-friendly software ESHAPE for public service, integrating better contour extraction, efficient EFDs calculation, and true EFD normalization under all basic contour transformations.
